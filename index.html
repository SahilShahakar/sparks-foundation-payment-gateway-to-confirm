        <p>“I don’t think you ever stop giving. I really don’t. I think it’s an
          on-going process. And it’s not just about being able to write a check.
          It’s being able to touch somebody’s life.”

      <div class="container">
        <p>We have reached out to marginalized families in need and are helping
           medical institutions that require support. Here is some of the work
           that we have done across our programme areas in India. A small amount
           can change the life of a child; through education,
           nutrition, and basic protection, children can lead normal lives.
           The adjacent graph is a representation of how we have utilised your
           donations.
